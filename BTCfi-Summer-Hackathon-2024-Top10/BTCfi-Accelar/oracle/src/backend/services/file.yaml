# Welcome to the Akash Network! 🚀☁
# This file is called a Stack Definition Laguage (SDL)
# SDL is a human friendly data standard for declaring deployment attributes. 
# The SDL file is a "form" to request resources from the Network. 
# SDL is compatible with the YAML standard and similar to Docker Compose files.

# The top-level services entry contains a map of workloads to be ran on the Akash deployment. Each key is a service name; values are a map containing the following keys:
